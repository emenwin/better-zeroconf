Better ZeroConf is a multicast DNS-SD browser application
and library for the Android platform.

It is implemented using the JmDNS library as an Android service,
allowing multiple activities within in an application to
share the service.

To build it, you will need to import the two ADT projects provided
alongside a "jmdns" project, imported straight from their repository.

Features:

 * based on JmDNS
 * implemented as a service

Coming soon:

 * publishing support
